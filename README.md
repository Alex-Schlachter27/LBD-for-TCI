# LBD-for-TCI

This GitHub Repository is based on the master thesis "Unlocking the value of Linked Building Data (LBD) - A lean and integrated management process of temporary
construction items (TCIs)" and provides files and information of the developments within the research project. Using Linked Building Data to manage BIM data from different data sources and automatically generate a TCI utilization plan and tracking, the paper proposes a new approach of how TCIs can be considered in construction planning and management to improve productivity and safety as construction sites. 

The GitHub repository publicly provides access to all programs and other files that were developed and utilized for both the demo project and the case study. Furthermore, it contains the newly created ontologies as well as the submitted thesis paper, including all appendices.

The Repository contains the following directories:

# Ontologies: 
This folder contains the Linked Data ontologies that were created for this thesis. The main contribution is the TCI ontology, describing the whole context of TCI utilization in construction with the focus on formwork elements. The LBS ontology holds information to describe the location-based schedule. For the Revit data, no additional ontology was created as existing ones were utilized to cover the scope of describing the building elements.

# Demo Project: 
This folder is structured in accordance with the big data value chain, providing access to the utilized files in the demo project. Going from data extraction to data visualization, it comprises all steps of the developed solution with the utilized programs, at the status of the first prototyping phase.

# Case Study: 
This directory is structured the same way as the Demo Project folder and contains the files that were utilized in the case study application. It also contains the developed Power BI dashboard as the final result of the prototype process. As the VICO-files Take-Off-System and Cost-Plan are too large for this repository, they are submitted via the following link, containing the entire thesis submission:

# Thesis Submission: 
This folder contains the thesis paper and all appendices as separate files.
